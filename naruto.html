            <h2>NARUTO</h2>
    Naruto Uzumaki is a young boy from the Hidden Leaf Village and the biggest problem child at the ninja academy. He causes mischief every day and is constantly being scolded by his teacher, Iruka Umino. He has fallen so far behind in his studies that his graduation is uncertain, but Naruto actually dreams of becoming the leader of the village, known as the Hokage, and vows to one day become the No. 1 ninja.
        <br>
        However, all the adults in the village treat Naruto with disdain due to a secret surrounding his birth. 12 years ago, when Naruto was just a baby, the Nine-Tailed Fox attacked the village, and the only way to stop it was to seal it inside of him. This fact is first revealed to him by Mizuki, an instructor at the academy who uses Naruto to steal the Scroll of Sealing from the current Hokage. Once the deed is done, he appears before the young ninja and discloses the shocking truth behind his birth. Naruto manages to defeat Mizuki with Iruka’s help, who despite knowing about Naruto’s past, has always believed in him. After learning Iruka’s true feelings, Naruto gains a renewed determination to pursue his dream.
        <br>
        After successfully graduating from the academy alongside fellow students Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, Naruto finally takes the first steps on his journey as a real ninja!

        The Great Ninja War that shook the entire world has now faded into memory along with the many shinobi whose lives it cost, and the Hidden Leaf Village has entered an age of peace and prosperity with Naruto Uzumaki as the Seventh Hokage. Meanwhile, his son, Boruto Uzumaki, struggles with living in the shadow of his remarkable father.
        <br>
        Though Boruto may rebel against Naruto’s wishes, he also longs to be recognized by his father as a shinobi and forms his own three-man squad with Sarada and Mitsuki to take the Chunin Exams.
        <br>
        To that end, he undergoes training from Sasuke, Sarada’s father and Naruto’s former rival, to learn the ways of ninjutsu.
However, the exams prove too difficult for Boruto, and he resorts to using a scientific ninja tool, despite such items being prohibited…
